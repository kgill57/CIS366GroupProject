	<h3>Specific UX decisions</h3>
		<p>One of the first UX decisions we made was to decide on a color scheme. We used Paletton to come up with a viable scheme
		that we thought represented the idea of sustainability. The decision to choose a color scheme affects the accessibility of 
		the site along with the desirability of the site as well.  Additional time was also spend creating a navigation bar that would
		make navigating between the various sites easy. The navigation consideration was primarily dealing with the UX principles of 
		findable and usable. 
		</p>
	<h3>Difficulties</h3>
		<p>Over the course of the project we did run into a few difficulties with certain things. One of the major difficulties we 
		encountered was getting the slide show to display pictures properly and to not have them weirdly rotated. Another difficulty
		we had was deciding on a good looking/appropriate color scheme. The final thing we had difficulty with was getting the textbox
		to pop up on the form.
		</p>
	<h3>Decisions regarding design and page layout</h3>
		<p></p>
	<h3>Thoughts on sustainability</h3>
		<p>Our thoughts on sustainability are mixed. We believe that sustainability is a philosophy that needs to be embraced by people 
		all over the planet, but at the same time we are worried that it might just be the current trendy “buzzword”. Only to be brushed
		aside and ignored when the next trendy idea or philosophy comes along. While this is one of our legitimate concerns with the 
		philosophy of sustainability we do hope that this philosophy does become a permanent fixture around the world.  Our opinion did
		not really change over the course of the project, but we did gain a greater awareness for sustainability efforts that our happening
		around JMU. Prior to this project we were aware that SSC was environmentally friendly but we were not aware that it was required to 
		accomplish so many feats of sustainability in order to receive the LEEDS Gold certification. We thoroughly enjoyed getting to learn
		about the special features and processes like SSC’s waste mitigation process that enable the building to receive the Gold certification.
