				<h3>Specific UX decisions</h3>
					<p>One of the first UX decisions we made was to decide on a color scheme. We used Paletton to come up with a viable scheme that we thought
					represented the idea of sustainability. The decision to choose a color scheme affects the accessibility of the site along with the desirability
					of the site as well.  Additional time was also spent creating a navigation bar that would make navigating between the various sites easy.
					The navigation consideration was primarily dealing with the UX principles of findable and usable. Throughout the design process for our sites
					we also were dealing with the UX principle of Credibility. Credibility is an important UX principle since people will not trust your site and
					may not use it if they deem that the information or design is not credible. Therefore, we attempted to have our site look credible and consistent
					across different screen sizes. Lastly, we wanted the site to provide useful information to the user with minimal fluff. Therefore, we tried
					to display the in an orderly and efficient manner.
					</p>
				<h3>Difficulties</h3>
					<p>Over the course of the project we did run into a few difficulties with certain things. One of the major difficulties we encountered
					was getting the slide show to display pictures properly and to not have them weirdly rotated. Another difficulty we had was deciding on
					a good looking/appropriate color scheme. Additionally, we had difficulty with getting the textbox to pop up on the form. Lastly, we had
					some difficulty resizing the homepage initially, although we were eventually able to resize it effectively so that it looked professional
					and had the same content.
					</p>
				<h3>Decisions regarding design and page layout</h3>
					<p>When taking into account design decisions for various screen sizes we needed to determine how we wanted the users to view our content.
					The first thing we talked about was making sure the page had a linear progression that looked neat in a vertical format. We decided that
					the logo should be at the top and centered and that we should have the links to our other sites appear vertically (instead of horizontally
					like on the previous pages). We feel that with these changes the top of the sites would look professional and crisp when used on different
					screen sizes. After deciding on the top navigation and logo decisions we tried our best to layout the content in a vertical manner that
					looked good and displayed the same information as the page normally would (This includes pictures, slideshows, and other content). For two
					out of the three responsive sites this was not much of an issue. As for the homepage we had a little difficulty getting everything to line
					up the way we wanted it to with the various pictures and the slideshow. After fixing the aforementioned issues we were able to effectively
					create external CSS sheets that enabled the three responsive pages to be viewed by the users with no loss of content or design issues.  
					</p>
				<h3>Thoughts on sustainability</h3>
					<p>Our thoughts on sustainability are mixed. We believe that sustainability is a philosophy that needs to be embraced by people all over the
					planet, but at the same time we are worried that it might just be the current trendy “buzzword”. While this is one of our legitimate concerns
					with the philosophy of sustainability we do hope that this philosophy does become a permanent fixture around the world. Since, our planet is
					our only current option for survival and currently we are degrading it at an unsustainable pace. Over the course of the project our opinion
					did not really change, but we did gain a greater awareness for sustainability efforts that our happening around JMU. Prior to this project
					we were aware that SSC was environmentally friendly but we were not aware that it needed to accomplish so many feats of sustainability in
					order to receive the LEEDS Gold certification. We thoroughly enjoyed getting to learn about the special features and processes like SSC’s waste
					mitigation process that enable the building to receive the Gold certification.
