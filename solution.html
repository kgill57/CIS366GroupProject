        <h1 class="header">The Student Success Center's Water Conservation Movement</h1>
        
        <p>
            As one of the newest buildings on campus, The Student Success Center is leading the charge to have the JMU campus become more environmentally friendly. The building received the U.S. 
            Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, and shows the commitment of JMU to reduce environmental impact through design and construction. 
            One of the most noticeable efforts of the building comes from water conservation.

            <h3>Water Fountains</h3>
            <p>
                At the Student Success Center, every water fountain is equipped with a nozzle to fill water bottles. These stations encourage students and faculty to refill their water bottles rather than 
                purchasing new plastic bottles. Each station comes equipped with a small screen that reads the number of water bottles saved from refills. This helps both the consumer and the environment in the 
                long run, reducing the cost of buying water bottles and the amount of plastic that is disposed.

            <h3>Pillars of Sustainability</h3>
            <p>
                The water conservation in the Student Success Center hits all three pillars of sustainability. The water fountains encourage reusing water bottles, reducing the plastic footprint of the building. 
                This satisfies Environmental sustainability because it reduces disruption of the natural environment, and moves the building towards a more Z-squared approach. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The water fountains also satisfy the economic sustainability of the consumer. As bottles get refilled, consumers are saving the cost of purchasing an entirely new water bottle. For example, in the 
                picture below, 7,173 water bottles were saved from that fountain alone. That’s nearly $10,760 in water bottles if they are $1.50 each!
            </p>
            <p>
                The water conservation of SSC satisfies the social sustainability pillar as well. Every single fountain in SSC is equipped with these nozzles, and it is showing future contractors the power of 
                being efficient with water new buildings on campus. It encourages JMU and other universities to build buildings like SSC. SSC also encourages students and faculty to be more “green” at home. If you’re 
                being environmentally conscious at work and school, it’s easy to continue the trend at home!
