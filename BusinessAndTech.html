<h3>How Drones Help the Environment</h3>
<p>
    In today's age, drones are being used by several companies and environmental agencies to make 
    an impact on sustainability. The International Anti-Poaching Foundation (IAPF) uses drone
    technology to monitor animals in their natural environment. The drones use a combination of
    thermal imaging cameras and movement detection to monitor wildlife and prevent poachers. 
    The IAPF also trains Green Army Rangers to protect the animals through direct action. If the
    IAPF detects that an animal is in danger, they will send out their Rangers.

    The Environmental Protection Agency also uses drones to monitor pollution levels in the air. 
    Their drones come equipped with geo-spatial air pollution measuring capabilities, and they are used 
    to test the air quality around oil and gas facilities. If there are abnormal levels of emissions in the 
    air, an in-depth inspection may be administered to further analyze the area. This helps 
    ensure that industries comply with environmental law.
